You are given two strings $S$ and $R$. Each of these strings has length $N$. We want to make $S$ equal to $R$ by performing the following operation some number of times (possibly zero):
Choose two integers $a$ and $b$ such that $1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ N$.
For each $i$ such that $a ≤ i ≤ b$, replace the $i$-th character of $S$ by the $i$-th character of $R$.

Suppose that we make $S$ equal to $R$ by performing this operation $k$ times, in such a way that the total number of replaced characters (i.e. the sum of all $k$ values of $b-a+1$) is $l$. Then, the cost of this process is defined as $k \cdot l$.

Find the minimum cost with which we can make $S$ equal to $R$.

------  Input ------
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single string $S$.
The second line contains a single string $R$.

------  Output ------
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum cost.

------  Constraints ------
$1 ≤ T ≤ 4,000$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{6}$
$|S| = |R| = N$
$S$ and $R$ contain only lowercase English letters
the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^{6}$

Example case 1: $S$ can be made equal to $R$ in two moves. First, we replace $S_{1}$ by $R_{1}$ and then replace $S_{5}$ by $R_{5}$. We have $k = l = 2$, so the cost is $2 \cdot 2 = 4$. If we wanted to perform only one operation, the cost would be $5$.
