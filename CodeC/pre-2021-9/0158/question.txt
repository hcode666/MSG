Chefu is Chef's little brother, he is 12 years old and he is new to competitive programming.

Chefu is practicing very hard to become a very skilled competitive programmer and win gold medal in IOI.

Now Chefu is participating in a contest and the problem that he is trying to solve states:

Given an array A of N integers, find any i, j such that i <  j 
and A_{i} + A_{j} is maximum possible 

unfortunately, there's no much time left before the end of the contest, so Chefu doesn't have time to think of correct solution, so instead, he wrote a solution that selects a random pair (i,  j) (i <  j) and output A_{i} + A_{j}. each pair is equiprobable to be selected.
Now Chefu wants your help to calculate the probability that his solution will pass a particular input.

------ Input ------ 

First line contains an integer T denoting the number of test-cases.

First line of each test-case contains a single integer N

Second line of each test-case contains N space-separated integers A_{1} A_{2} ... A_{N}

------ Output ------ 

For each test-case output a single line containing a single number denoting the probability that Chefu's solution to output a correct answer. your answer will be accepted if the absolute difference between it and correct answer is less than 1e-6

------ Constraints ------ 

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
2 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ A_{i} ≤ 1,000
