Chef likes problems which using some math. Now he asks you to solve next one. You have 4 integers, Chef wondering is there non-empty subset which has sum equals 0.

------ Input ------ 

The first line of input contains T - number of test cases. 
Each of the next T lines containing four pairwise distinct integer numbers - a, b, c, d.

------ Output ------ 

For each test case output "Yes", if possible to get 0 by choosing non-empty subset of {a, b, c, d} with sum equal 0, or "No" in another case.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 10^{3}$
$-10^{6} ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 10^{6} $

----- Sample Input 1 ------ 
3

1 2 0 3

1 2 4 -1

1 2 3 4
----- Sample Output 1 ------ 
Yes

Yes

No
----- explanation 1 ------ 
Example case 1. We can choose subset {0} 
Example case 2. We can choose subset {-1, 1}
