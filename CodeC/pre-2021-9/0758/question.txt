Chef has a sequence of positive integers $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{N}$. He wants to split this sequence into two non-empty (not necessarily contiguous) subsequences $B$ and $C$ such that $\mathrm{GCD}\,(B) + \mathrm{GCD}\,(C)$ is maximum possible. Help him find this maximum value.

Note: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a sequence of positive integers is the largest positive integer that divides each element of this sequence. For example, the GCD of the sequence $(8, 12)$ is $4$.

------  Input ------
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{N}$.

------  Output ------
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum value of $\mathrm{GCD}\,(B) + \mathrm{GCD}\,(C)$.

------  Constraints  ------
$1 ≤ T ≤ 10$
$2 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ A_{i} ≤ 10^{9}$ for each valid $i$

------  Subtasks ------
Subtask #1 (20 points): $2 ≤ N ≤ 20$

Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints

Example case 1: For example, the sequence $A$ can be divided into subsequences $B = (4, 4, 6)$ and $C = (7)$.
