Watson gives an array A of N integers A_{1}, A_{2}, ..., A_{N} to Sherlock. He wants Sherlock to reorganize the array in a way such that no two adjacent numbers differ by more than 1.
Formally, if reorganized array is B_{1}, B_{2}, ..., B_{N}, then the condition that | B_{i} - B_{i + 1} | ≤ 1, for all 1 ≤ i < N(where |x| denotes the absolute value of x) should be met.
Sherlock is not sure that a solution exists, so he asks you.

------ Input ------ 

First line contains T, number of test cases. Each test case consists of N in one line followed by N integers in next line denoting A_{1}, A_{2}, ..., A_{N}.

------ Output ------ 

For each test case, output in one line YES or NO denoting if array A can be reorganized in required way or not.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 100$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ A_{i} ≤  10^{9}$
$Sum of N over all test cases  ≤ 2*10^{5}$
