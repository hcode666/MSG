You are given a sequence $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{N}$. You may perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (including zero): choose two adjacent elements of this sequence, i.e. $A_{i}$, $A_{i+1}$ for some valid $i$, and swap them. However, for each valid $i$, it is not allowed to choose $A_{i}$ (the element with the index $i$, regardless of its value at any point in time) more than once in total during this process.

Find the maximum of the sum $S = \sum_{i=1}^N A_{i} \cdot i$.

------  Input ------
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{N}$.

------  Output ------
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum possible value of $S$.

------  Constraints ------
$1 ≤ T ≤ 1,000$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ A_{i} ≤ 10^{9}$ for each valid $i$
the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^{6}$

------  Subtasks ------
Subtask #1 (50 points):
$N ≤ 20$
the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $200$

Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints

Example case 1: Swap the first and second element of the initial sequence. Then, swap the third and fourth element of the resulting sequence. The final sequence $A$ is $(1, 2, 3, 4)$.

Example case 2: Swap the second and third element to make the sequence $(7, 3, 6, 2)$.
