Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv hates exams. Since Little Elephant lives in Ukraine, he is going to take exams called 'ZNO'. Help him.
There will be n tickets on the table. Each ticket has a number written on it. The i-th ticket can be numbered A_{i} with probability P_{i} percent and with probability 100-P_{i} percent it can be numbered B_{i}. It can not have any other number. A numbering of tickets on the table is correct if and only if all tickets have distinct ticket numbers.

Help Little Elephant find the probability that the numbering will be correct.

------ Input ------ 

The first line of the input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n - the number of tickets on the table. n lines will follow. Each of these lines contains three integers: P_{i},  A_{i} and B_{i}.

------ Output ------ 

Output T lines, each containing a single real number - answer for the corresponding test case. Rounding errors less than 10^{-6} will be ignored.

------ Constraints ------ 

1 ≤ T ≤ 10

1 ≤ n ≤ 50

1 ≤ A_{i}, B_{i} ≤ 16

0 ≤ P_{i} ≤ 100
