Chef likes strings a lot but moreover he likes good strings. Chef calls a string str a good string if str starts and ends at different characters. For eg : strings such as abab , baccba , abc are all good strings whereas strings like aba, baab , baacaab are not good at all .
Today, Chef has a special string P consisting of lower case letters "c" , "h" , "e" and "f" only. Chef wants to make some queries about his string P.
Each of chef's query has the following form a b L R. For a given query, Chef wants to count the number of good strings which starts at letter a and ends at letter b such that starting index S_{i} and ending index E_{i} of a chosen substring satisfies L ≤ S_{i} < E_{i} ≤ R.
NOTE
Two substrings P_{1} and P_{2} are considered to be different if either S_{1} != S_{2} or E_{1} != E_{2} where S_{1},E_{1} and S_{2},E_{2} are the starting and ending index of string P_{1} and string P_{2} respectively.
Chef is not able to accomplish this task efficiently. Can you help him ? 

------ Input ------ 

First line of the input contains a string P denoting the chef's special string. Next line of the input contains a single integer Q denoting the number of chef's queries. Next Q lines of the input contains four space separated parameters where the first two parameters are characters denoting a and b respectively and rest two are integers denoting L and R respectively.

------ Output ------ 

For each chef's query, print the required answer.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ |P| ≤ 10^{6}$
$1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^{6}$
$1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ |P|$
$P,a,b belongs to the set of lower case letters [c,h,e,f] and a != b. 		
$$All test files are strictly according to constraints.$

------ Subtasks ------
