You are given a square matrix $M$ with $N$ rows (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $N$ columns (numbered $1$ through $N$). Initially, all the elements of this matrix are equal to $A$. The matrix is broken down in $N$ steps (numbered $1$ through $N$); note that during this process, some elements of the matrix are simply marked as *removed*, but all elements are still indexed in the same way as in the original matrix. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th step consists of the following:
Elements $M_{1, N-i+1}, M_{2, N-i+1}, \ldots, M_{i-1, N-i+1}$ are removed.
Elements $M_{i, N-i+1}, M_{i, N-i+2}, \ldots, M_{i, N}$ are removed.
Let's denote the product of all $2i-1$ elements removed in this step by $p_{i}$. Each of the remaining elements of the matrix (those which have not been removed yet) is multiplied by $p_{i}$.

Find the sum $p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} + \ldots + p_{N}$. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo $10^{9}+7$.

------  Input ------
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $A$.

------  Output ------
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the sum of products at each step modulo $10^{9}+7$.

------  Constraints ------
$1 ≤ T ≤ 250$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}$
$0 ≤ A ≤ 10^{9}$
the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^{5}$
