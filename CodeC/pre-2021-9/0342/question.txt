Eidi gifts are a tradition in which children receive money from elder relatives during the Eid celebration.

Chef has three children (numbered $1, 2, 3$) and he wants to give them Eidi gifts. The oldest child, Chefu, thinks that a distribution of money is fair only if an older child always receives more money than a younger child; if two children have the same age, they should receive the same amounts of money.

For each valid $i$, the $i$-th child is $A_{i}$ years old and it received $C_{i}$ units of money. Determine whether this distribution of money is fair.

------  Input ------
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains six space-separated integers $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, $A_{3}$, $C_{1}$, $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$.

------  Output ------
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "FAIR" if the distribution is fair or "NOT FAIR" otherwise.

------  Constraints ------
$1 ≤ T ≤ 1,000$
$1 ≤ A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3} ≤ 17$
$1 ≤ C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3} ≤ 100$

----- explanation 1 ------ 
Example case 2: All children have same age which is 5, but second child got less money than the other children, so it's not fair.

Example case 3: First child is older than second child but he got less money than him, so it's not fair.

Example case 4: First and third children have same age, but didn't get same amount of money,  so it's not fair.
