Are you fond of collecting some kind of stuff? Mike is crazy about collecting stamps. He is an active member of Stamp Collecting Сommunity(SCC). 

SCC consists of N members which are fond of philately. A few days ago Mike argued with the others from SCC. Mike told them that all stamps of the members could be divided in such a way that i'th member would get i postage stamps. Now Mike wants to know if he was right. The next SCC meeting is tomorrow. Mike still has no answer.

So, help Mike! There are N members in the SCC, i'th member has C_{i} stamps in his collection. Your task is to determine if it is possible to redistribute C_{1} + C_{2} + ... + C_{n} stamps among the members of SCC thus that i'th member would get i stamps.

------ Input ------ 

The first line contains one integer N, denoting the number of members of SCC.
The second line contains N integers C_{i}, denoting the numbers of the stamps in the collection of i'th member.

------ Output ------ 

The first line should contain YES, if we can obtain the required division, otherwise NO.

------ Constraints ------ 

1 ≤ N ≤ 100 000;
1 ≤  C_{i} ≤ 10^{9}.
