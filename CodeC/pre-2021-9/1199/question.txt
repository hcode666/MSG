You are given a sequence of n integers a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{n} and an integer d.
Find the length of the shortest non-empty contiguous subsequence with sum of elements at least d. Formally, you should find the smallest positive integer k with the following property: there is an integer s (1 ≤ s ≤ N-k+1) such that a_{s} + a_{s+1} + ... + a_{s+k-1} ≥ d.

------ Input ------ 

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers n and d.
The second line contains n space-separated integers a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{n}.

------ Output ------ 

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the length of the shortest contiguous subsequence with sum of elements ≥ d. If there is no such subsequence, print -1 instead.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}$
$-10^{9} ≤ d ≤ 10^{9}$
$-10^{4} ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{4}$
$1 ≤ sum of n over all test cases ≤ 2 · 10^{5}$
