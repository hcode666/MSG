Chef Tobby is playing a rapid fire with Bhuvan. He gives Bhuvan a string S and each time, Bhuvan has to guess whether there exists 2 equal subsequences in the string or not.

Bhuvan got a perfect score in the game with Chef Tobby. However, Chef Tobby has now asked Bhuvan to write a program that will do this automatically given a string S. Bhuvan is an intelligent man but he does not know how to write a code. Can you help him?

Find two different subsequences such that they are equal in their value, more formally, find two sequences of indices (a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{k-1}, a_{k}) and (b_{1}, b_{2}, ..., b_{k-1}, b_{k}) such that:

1≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ |S|
a_{i} < a_{i+1} for all valid i
b_{i} < b_{i+1} for all valid i
Sa_{i} = Sb_{i} for all valid i
there exist at least one i such that a_{i} is not equal to b_{i}

------ Input section ------ 

The first line contains T, the number of test cases.

Each of the next T lines contain one string S each.

Input will only consist of lowercase english characters

------ Output section ------ 

For each test case, output "yes" or "no" (without quotes) as the solution to the problem.

------ Input constraints ------ 

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ length of S ≤ 100

In test case 2, one of the possible equal subsequence is "vi" and "vi". (one at position {0, 3} and other at {4, 7}, assuming 0-based indexing).

In test case 4, one of the possible equal subsequence is "ce" and "ce". (one at position {0, 3} and other at {4, 6}, assuming 0-based indexing).
