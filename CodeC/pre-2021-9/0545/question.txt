You are given a sequence of integers $A_{1},A_{2},…,A_{N}$ and a magical non-zero integer $x$
You have to select a subsegment of sequence A (possibly empty), and replace the elements in that subsegment after dividing them by x.

Formally, replace any one subsegment $A_{l}, A_{l+1}, ..., A_{r}$ with $A_{l}/x, A_{l+1}/x, ..., A_{r}/x$ where $l ≤ r$
    
What is the minimum possible sum you can obtain?

Note: The given operation can only be performed once

------ Input  ------ 

The first line of the input contains two positive integer n denoting the size of array, and x
denoting the magical integer
Next line contains $N$ space separated integers

------ Output ------ 

Single line containing one real number, denoting the minimum possible sum you can obtain. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-2}$

------ Constraints ------ 

$$1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{3}$$
$$1 ≤ |x| ≤ 10^{3}$$
$$ |A_{i}| ≤ 10^{3}$$

----- Sample Input 1 ------ 
3 2
1 -2 3
----- Sample Output 1 ------ 
0.5
----- explanation 1 ------ 
Array 1 -2 3, selecting subsegment {3}, you get 1 -2 1.5, which gives $sum=0.5$
