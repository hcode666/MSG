In the magical land of Byteland, there are three kinds of citizens:
a Bit - $2\;\mathrm{ms}$ after a Bit appears, it grows up and becomes a Nibble (i.e. it disappears and a Nibble appears)
a Nibble - $8\;\mathrm{ms}$ after a Nibble appears, it grows up and becomes a Byte
a Byte - $16\;\mathrm{ms}$ after a Byte appears, it grows up, splits into two Bits and disappears

Chef wants to know the answer to the following question: what would the population of Byteland be immediately before the time $N\;\mathrm{ms}$ if only 1 Bit appeared at time $0\;\mathrm{ms}$?

Help him and find the population (number of citizens) of each type.

------  Input ------
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. 

------  Output ------
For each test case, print a single line containing three space-separated integers — the number of Bits, Nibbles and Bytes.

------  Constraints  ------
$1 ≤ T ≤ 10^{4}$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 1,600$

------  Subtasks ------
Subtask #1 (25 points): $1 ≤ N ≤ 140$

Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

----- Sample Output 1 ------

0 1 0
----- explanation 1 ------ 
Immediately before the time $2\;\mathrm{ms}$, there is only one Bit. At $2\;\mathrm{ms}$, this Bit grows up, so immediately before $3\;\mathrm{ms}$, there is only one Nibble in Byteland.
