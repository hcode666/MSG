VK gave a problem to Chef, but Chef is too lazy, so he asked you to solve the problem for him. The statement of the problem follows.

Consider an integer with $N$ digits (in decimal notation, without leading zeroes) $D_{1}, D_{2}, D_{3}, \dots, D_{N}$. Here, $D_{1}$ is the most significant digit and $D_{N}$ the least significant. The *weight* of this integer is defined as $$\sum_{i=2}^N (D_{i} - D_{i-1})\,.$$

You are given integers $N$ and $W$. Find the number of positive integers with $N$ digits (without leading zeroes) and weight equal to $W$. Compute this number modulo $10^{9}+7$.

------  Input ------
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $W$ denoting the number of digits and the required weight.

------  Output ------
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of $N$-digit positive integers with weight $W$, modulo $10^{9}+7$.

------  Constraints ------
$1 ≤ T ≤ 10^{5}$
$2 ≤ N ≤ 10^{18}$
$|W| ≤ 300$

------  Subtasks ------
Subtask #1 (20 points):
$1 ≤ T ≤ 10^{3}$
$2 ≤ N ≤ 10^{3}$

Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints

Example case 1: Remember that the digits are arranged from most significant to least significant as $D_{1}, D_{2}$. The two-digit integers with weight $3$ are $14, 25, 36, 47, 58, 69$. For example, the weight of $14$ is $D_{2}-D_{1} = 4-1 = 3$. We can see that there are no other possible numbers.
