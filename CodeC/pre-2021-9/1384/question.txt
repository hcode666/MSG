Consider a grid with $H$ rows (numbered $1$ through $H$) and $W$ columns (numbered $1$ through $W$). Let's denote the value in a cell in row $i$ and column $j$ by $h_{i,j}$. $N$ particles (numbered $1$ through $N$) are distributed in the cells in such a way that there is at most one particle in each cell. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th particle has a value $p_{i}$ and it is placed in the cell in row $y_{i}$ and column $x_{i}$.

Let's denote the set of all particles by $P$ and the set of all unordered pairs of particles that are located in side-adjacent cells by $E$. We define the value of the grid as
$$V = \sum_{i \in P} p_{i} \cdot h_{y_{i},x_{i}} + \sum_{(i,j) \in E} p_{i} \cdot p_{j} \,.$$

You are given the grid and the locations of all particles, but not their exact values ― only $\lvert p_{1} \rvert, \lvert p_{2} \rvert, \ldots, \lvert p_{N} \rvert$. Your task is to choose the sign of each value $p_{i}$ in such a way that the value $V$ is maximum possible. Each sign may be chosen independently from all other signs.

------  Input ------
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $H$, $W$ and $N$.
$H$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains $W$ space-separated integers $h_{i,1}, h_{i,2}, \ldots, h_{i,W}$.
$N$ more lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers $y_{i}$, $x_{i}$ and $\lvert p_{i} \rvert$.

------  Output ------
For each test case, print two lines.
The first of these lines should contain a single integer ― the maximum value of $V$.
The second line should contain $N$ space-separated integers. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these integers should be $1$ if you choose a positive sign for the value of the $i$-th particle (i.e. its value should be $\lvert p_{i} \rvert$) or $-1$ if you choose a negative sign (i.e. its value should be $-\lvert p_{i} \rvert$).

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
