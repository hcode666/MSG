Chef loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Let F_{d}(x) equals to the number of digits d in decimal representation of the positive integer x. Chef interests only in functions F_{4}(x) and F_{7}(x). For the given positive integer N he wants to know the total number of different pairs (L; R) such that  F_{4}(L) + F_{4}(L + 1) + ... + F_{4}(R) equals to  F_{7}(L) + F_{7}(L + 1) + ... + F_{7}(R) and 1 ≤  L ≤ R ≤ N.

------ Input ------ 

The first line contains a single positive integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a positive integer N .

------ Output ------ 

For each test case, output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case.

------ Constraints ------ 

1 ≤ T ≤ 100000

1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
