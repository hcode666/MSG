"What do you know about happiness?" — Yoda 

Chef is happy only if three conditions hold:
Chef finished cooking a delicious meal
Chef got AC for a programming problem with an almost correct code
Chef got a new problem with a sequence of integers

Today, all three conditions are satisfied. Chef would like you to feel his happiness and provide him with a solution for this new problem with a sequence of integers. The problem is as follows.

You are given a sequence $A_{1}, A_{2}, \dots, A_{N}$. You need to determine if it is possible to choose two indices $i$ and $j$ such that $A_{i} \neq A_{j}$, but $A_{A_{i}}$ = $A_{A_{j}}$. (If it was possible, Chef would be truly happy.)

------  Input ------
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{N}$.

------  Output ------
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Truly Happy" if it is possible to choose required indices or "Poor Chef" otherwise.

------  Constraints ------
$1 ≤ T ≤ 1,000$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ A_{i} ≤ N$ for each valid $i$
the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^{5}$

------  Subtasks ------
Subtask #1 (27 points): $1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000$

Subtask #2 (73 points): original constraints

----- explanation 1 ------ 
Example case 1: Chef is truly happy because $A_{A_{3}} = A_{A_{1}}$ and $A_{3} \neq A_{1}$.

Example case 2: There is no pair of indices which would make Chef truly happy. For instance, $A_{A_{3}} = A_{A_{4}}$, but $A_{3} = A_{4}$,
