Lately, Chef has been inspired by the "pawri" meme. Therefore, he decided to take a string $S$ and change each of its substrings that spells "party" to "pawri". Find the resulting string.

------  Input ------
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$.

------  Output ------
For each test case, print a single line containing the string after it is modified by Chef.

------  Constraints ------
$1 ≤ T ≤ 10$
$1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^{5}$
$S$ contains only lowercase English letters
