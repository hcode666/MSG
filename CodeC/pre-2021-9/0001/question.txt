There are 3 problems in a contest namely A, B, C respectively. Alice bets Bob that problem C is the hardest while Bob says that problem B will be the hardest. 

You are given three integers S_{A}, S_{B}, S_{C} which denotes the number of successful submissions of the problems A, B, C respectively. It is guaranteed that each problem has a different number of submissions. Determine who wins the bet.

1) If Alice wins the bet (i.e. problem C is the hardest), then output Alice.

2) If Bob wins the bet (i.e. problem B is the hardest), then output Bob.

3) If no one wins the bet (i.e. problem A is the hardest), then output Draw.

Note: The hardest problem is the problem with the least number of successful submissions.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers S_{A}, S_{B}, S_{C}, denoting the number of successful submissions of problems A, B, C respectively. 

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, output the winner of the bet or print Draw in case no one wins the bet.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 100$
$1 ≤ S_{A},S_{B},S_{C} ≤ 100$
$S_{A}, S_{B}, S_{C}$ are all distinct.

Alice

----- explanation 1 ------ 
Test case $1$:  Problem $A$ turns out to be the hardest so no one wins the bet.

Test case $2$:  Problem $B$ turns out to be the hardest so Bob wins the bet.

Test case $3$:  Problem $C$ turns out to be the hardest so Alice wins the bet.
