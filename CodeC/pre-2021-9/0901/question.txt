Chef has invited Alice for his birthday party. Now, Alice is thinking about what to give Chef as a present. She should obviously choose a sequence ― what could possibly be a better birthday gift than a sequence!

After some thinking, Alice chose a sequence of integers $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{N}$. However, she does not want to simply give this sequence to Chef. Instead, she decided to give Chef a sequence $B_{1}, B_{2}, \ldots, B_{N}$, where $B_{i} = \bigvee_{j=1}^i A_{j}$ for each valid $i$ and $\bigvee$ denotes the bitwise OR operation. Chef can try to generate a sequence $A$ from $B$, but there could be more than one such possible sequence.

Now, Alice is wondering how many sequences $A$ correspond to the given sequence $B$. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo $10^{9} + 7$. Note that it is not guaranteed that the given sequence $B$ was generated from some sequence $A$.

------  Input ------
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $B_{1}, B_{2}, \ldots, B_{N}$.

------  Output ------
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of possible sequences $A$ modulo $10^{9} + 7$.

------  Constraints ------
$1 ≤ T ≤ 25$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 5 \cdot 10^{4}$
$0 ≤ B_{i} < 2^{30}$ for each valid $i$
