You are given an integer sequence $A_{1}, A_{2}, \dots, A_{N}$. Let's define the *useful number* of a subsequence of $A$ as the number of distinct primes $p$ such that $p$ divides each member of the subsequence, multiplied by the length of the subsequence. Find the maximum of useful numbers of all subsequences of $A$.

------  Input ------
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
The second line contains $N$ space-seperated integers $A_{1}, A_{2}, \dots, A_{N}$.

------  Output ------
Print a single line containing one integer — the maximum useful number.

------  Constraints ------
$1 ≤ T ≤ 10$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ A_{i} ≤ 10^{5}$ for each valid $i$

Example case 1: The subsequence $[2, 2, 4, 8]$ has the maximum useful number. The number of distinct primes that divide each member of the subsequence is $1$ (only the prime $2$) and the length of the subsequence is $4$, so the useful number of this subsequence is $1\cdot 4 = 4$.
