Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian. 

You are given two positive integers – A and B. You have to check whether A is divisible by all the prime divisors of B.

------ Input ------ 

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
For each test case, you are given two space separated integers – A and B.

------ Output ------ 

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if A contains all prime divisors of B, otherwise print "No".

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 10^{4}$
$1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^{18}$

------ Subtasks ------ 

$Subtask 1 (20 points):1 ≤ B ≤ 10^{7}$
$Subtask 2 (30 points):1 ≤ A ≤ 10^{7}$
$Subtask 3 (50 points): Original constraints$

----- Sample Input 1 ------ 
3

120 75

128 16

7 8
----- Sample Output 1 ------ 
Yes

Yes

No
----- explanation 1 ------ 
Example case 1. In the first case 120 = 23*3*5 and 75 = 3*52. 120 is divisible by both 3 and 5. Hence, we will print "Yes"
Example case 2. In the second case both 128 and 16 are powers of two. Hence, the answer is "Yes"
Example case 3. In the third case 8 is power of two and 7 is not divisible by 2. So, the answer is "No"
