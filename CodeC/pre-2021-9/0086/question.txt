A great deal of energy is lost as metabolic heat when the organisms from one trophic level are consumed by the next level. 

Suppose in Chefland the energy reduces by a factor of K, i.e, if initially, the energy is X, then the transfer of energy to the next tropic level is \lfloor \frac{X} {K} \rfloor. This limits the length of foodchain which is defined to be the highest level receiving non-zero energy.

E is the energy at the lowest tropic level. Given E and K for an ecosystem, find the maximum length of foodchain.

Note: \lfloor x \rfloor denoted the floor function, and it returns the greatest integer that is less than or equal to x (i.e  rounds down to the nearest integer). For example, \lfloor 1.4 \rfloor = 1, \lfloor 5 \rfloor = 5, \lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2, \lfloor -3 \rfloor = -3 , \lfloor 0 \rfloor = 0.

TestCase $1$: The energy at first level is $5$ units. For the second level energy becomes $\lfloor \frac{5} {3} \rfloor = 1$ units. So the length of foodchain is $2$ since from the next level onwards $0$ units of energy will be received.

TestCase $3$: The energy at different levels is:
- Level $1$- $10$ units
- Level $2$- $\lfloor \frac{10} {2} \rfloor = 5$ units
- Level $3$- $\lfloor \frac{5} {2} \rfloor = 2$ units
- Level $4$- $\lfloor \frac{2} {2} \rfloor = 1$ units
- Level $5$- $\lfloor \frac{1} {2} \rfloor = 0$ units

So the answer is $4$, since it is the last level to receive non-zero energy.
