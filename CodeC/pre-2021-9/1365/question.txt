Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian. 
Sereja has an array A that contains n integers: A_{1}, A_{2}, ..., A_{n}. 
Sereja also has an array B that contains n integers B_{1}, B_{2}, ..., B_{n}. 
In a single step Sereja can choose two indexes i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n) , and increase all the elements of A with indices between i and j inclusively by one, modulo 4.
In other words, we make A_{p} equal to (A_{p} + 1) modulo 4 if p is an integer from the range [i; j].

Now Sereja is interested in the following question: what is the mininal number of steps necessary in order to make the array A equal to the array B.

------ Input ------ 

The first line contains an integer T - the number of the testcases. Then, T tests follow. 

The first line of each testcase contains the integer n. 

The next line conatins n single space separated integers - A_{1}, A_{2}, ..., A_{n}. 

The next line conatin n single space separated integers - B_{1}, B_{2}, ..., B_{n}.

------ Output ------ 

For each testcase output an answer - the mininal number of steps necessary.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 10$
$1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}$
$0 ≤ A_{i}, B_{i} ≤ 3$

------ Example ------ 

Input:
1
5
2 1 3 0 3
2 2 0 1 0

Output:
1
