Leha is a bright mathematician. Today he is investigating whether an integer is divisible by some square number or not.
He has a positive integer X represented as a product of N integers a_{1}, a_{2}, .... a_{N}. He has somehow figured out that there exists some integer P such that the number X is divisible by P^{2}, but he is not able to find such P himself. Can you find it for him? If there are more than one possible values of P possible, you can print any one of them.

------ Input ------ 

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains one integer N denoting the number of intgers in presentation of X.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a_{1}, a_{2}, .... a_{N}.

------ Output ------ 

For each test case, output a single integer P deoting the answer for this test case. Note that P must be in range from 2 to 10^{18} inclusive. It's guaranteed that at least one answer exists. If there are more than one possible answers, print any.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 5$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 100$
$1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{18}$

------ Subtasks ------ 

$Subtask 1[19 points]: 1 ≤ a_{1}*a_{2}*...*a_{N} ≤ 10^{6}$
$Subtask 2[22 points]: 1 ≤ a_{1}*a_{2}*...*a_{N} ≤ 10^{12}$
$Subtask 3[23 points]: 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{12}$
$Subtask 4[36 points]: no additional constraints$

----- Sample Input 1 ------ 
1
3
21 11 6
----- Sample Output 1 ------ 
3
----- explanation 1 ------ 
Example case 1. X = 21 * 11 * 6 = 1386. It's divisible by 9 which is a square number, as 9 = 32. So P = 3.
