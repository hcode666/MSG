Firdavs is living on planet F. There are $N$ cities (numbered $1$ through $N$) on this planet; let's denote the value of city $i$ by $v_{i}$. Firdavs can travel directly from each city to any other city. When he travels directly from city $x$ to city $y$, he needs to pay $f(x, y) = |v_{y}-v_{x}|+y-x$ coins (this number can be negative, in which case he receives $-f(x, y)$ coins).

Let's define a simple path from city $x$ to city $y$ with length $k ≥ 1$ as a sequence of cities $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{k}$ such that all cities in this sequence are different, $a_{1} = x$ and $a_{k} = y$. The cost of such a path is $\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} f(a_{i}, a_{i+1})$.

You need to answer some queries for Firdavs. In each query, you are given two cities $x$ and $y$, and you need to find the minimum cost of a simple path from city $x$ to city $y$. Then, you need to find the length of the longest simple path from $x$ to $y$ with this cost.

------  Input ------
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $Q$.
The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots, v_{N}$.
The following $Q$ lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers $x$ and $y$.

------  Output ------
For each query, print a single line containing two space-separated integers ― the minimum cost and the maximum length.

------  Constraints ------
$1 ≤ T ≤ 100$
$1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}$
$0 ≤ v_{i} ≤ 10^{9}$ for each valid $i$
$1 ≤ x, y ≤ N$
the sum of $N$ in all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^{5}$
the sum of $Q$ in all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^{5}$

------  Subtasks ------
Subtask #1 (30 points):
$1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 1,000$
$v_{1} < v_{2} < \ldots < v_{N}$
the sum of $N$ in all test cases does not exceed $5,000$
the sum of $Q$ in all test cases does not exceed $5,000$

Example case 1: For the first query, there are two paths with cost $4$ from city $2$ to city $3$:
- $2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 3$: cost $(|4-2|+1-2)+(|5-4|+3-1) = 4$, length $3$
- $2 \rightarrow 3$: cost $|5-2|+3-2 = 4$, length $2$

All other paths have greater costs, so the minimum cost is $4$. Among these two paths, we want the one with greater length, which is $3$.
