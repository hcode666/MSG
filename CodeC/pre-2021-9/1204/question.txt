You are given a sequence of positive integers $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{N}$. You should make all its elements equal by performing a sequence of operations.

In one operation, you may choose any contiguous subsequence $A_{l}, A_{l+1}, \ldots, A_{r}$ such that for each $i$ ($l+1 ≤ i ≤ r$), $A_{i} = A_{l}$, i.e. a sequence of identical elements, then choose any integer $x < A_{l}$, and for each $i$ ($l ≤ i ≤ r$), replace $A_{i}$ by $x$. The integers $x$ chosen in different operations may be different.

Find the smallest number of operations necessary to make all elements of the given sequence equal.

------  Input ------
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{N}$.

------  Output ------
Print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest number of operations.

------  Constraints ------
$1 ≤ T ≤ 100$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 5 \cdot 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ A_{i} ≤ 10^{9}$ for each valid $i$
the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^{5}$

------  Subtasks ------
Subtask #1 (50 points):
$A_{i} ≤ N$ for each valid $i$
the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5,000$

Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints
