Chef played an interesting game yesterday. This game is played with two variables $X$ and $Y$; initially, $X = Y = 0$. Chef may make an arbitrary number of moves (including zero). In each move, he must perform the following process:
Choose any positive integer $P$ such that $P \cdot P > Y$.
Change $X$ to $P$.
Add $P \cdot P$ to $Y$.

Unfortunately, Chef has a bad memory and he has forgotten the moves he made. He only remembers the value of $X$ after the game finished; let's denote it by $X_{f}$. Can you tell him the maximum possible number of moves he could have made in the game?

------  Input ------
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $X_{f}$.

------  Output ------
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum number of moves Chef could have made.

------  Constraints ------
$1 ≤ T ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ X_{f} ≤ 10^{9}$

Example case 2: One possible sequence of values of $X$ is $0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 8$.
