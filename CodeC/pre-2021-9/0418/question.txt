Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian. 

You are given an array of N integers a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{N} and an integer K. Find the number of such unordered pairs {i, j} that 
i ≠ j
|a_{i} + a_{j} - K| is minimal possible
Output  the minimal possible value of |a_{i} + a_{j} - K| (where i ≠ j) and the number of such pairs for the given array and the integer K.

------ Input ------ 

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case consists of two space separated integers - N and K respectively.

The second line contains N single space separated integers - a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{N} respectively.

------ Output ------ 

For each test case, output a single line containing two single space separated integers - the minimal possible value of |a_{i} + a_{j} - K| and the number of unordered pairs {i, j} for which this minimal difference is reached.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 50$
$1 ≤ a_{i}, K ≤ 10^{9}$
$N = 2 - 31 point.$
$2 ≤ N ≤ 1000 - 69 points.$
 
----- Sample Input 1 ------ 
1   
4 9
4 4 2 6
----- Sample Output 1 ------ 
1 4
----- explanation 1 ------ 
The minimal possible absolute difference of 1 can be obtained by taking the pairs of a1 and a2, a1 and a4, a2 and a4, a3 and a4.
