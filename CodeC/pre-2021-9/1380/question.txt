Chef has failed miserably in several cooking competitions, which makes him think that he's been out of luck recently. Therefore, he decided to build a magic circle using his N chopsticks (numbered 1 through N), hoping that it would somehow improve his luck.

The magic circle consists of N chopsticks placed on an infinite straight line (so it's not actually a circle). The line is drawn on the ground and chopsticks should be stuck vertically into the ground.

The chopsticks have lengths x_{1},x_{2},\cdots,x_{N}. For each valid i, the i-th chopstick can be placed on the line at any integer position y_{i}; then it casts a shadow on the range [y_{i},y_{i}+x_{i}] on the line. No two chopsticks may be placed at the same position.

The positions of the chopsticks should satisfy an additional condition: for each pair of neighbouring chopsticks i and j (such that there are no other chopsticks between them), the distances between these neighbouring chopsticks | y_{i} - y_{j} \right| must fall in a given range [L,U].

The magic power of the circle depends on the total shadowed length S=| \bigcup_{i} [y_{i},y_{i}+x_{i}] \right|. While Chef expects the circle to have the maximum effect, he must prepare for the worst-case scenario — due to his recent bad luck. Please help Chef find both the minimum and the maximum value of S.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, L and U.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers x_{1},x_{2},\cdots,x_{N}.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers S_{\min} and S_{\max}.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ L ≤ U ≤ 10^{9}$
$1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^{9}$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^{5}$

------ subtasks ------ 

Subtask #1 (5 points):
$T ≤ 5$
$N ≤ 3$

Subtask #2 (15 points):
$T ≤ 5$
$N ≤ 11$, and additionally $N > 5$ in at most one test case

Subtask #3 (30 points): $N ≤ 200$

Subtask #4 (50 points): original constraints

Example case 1:
- To minimize $S$, we may set $y_{1}=0$ and $y_{2}=2$.
- To maximize $S$, we may set $y_{1}=4$ and $y_{2}=0$.

Example case 2:
- To minimize $S$, we may set $y_{1}=2$, $y_{2}=1$ and $y_{3}=0$.
- To maximize $S$, we may set $y_{1}=0$, $y_{2}=1$ and $y_{3}=3$.

Example case 3:
- To minimize $S$, we may set $y_{1}=0$, $y_{2}=3$, $y_{3}=12$, $y_{4}=6$ and $y_{5}=9$.
- To maximize $S$, we may set $y_{1}=0$, $y_{2}=20$, $y_{3}=5$, $y_{4}=10$ and $y_{5}=15$.
