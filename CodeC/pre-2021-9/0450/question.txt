You are given an array of N integers. Find the *minimum* number of integers you need to delete from the array such that the absolute difference between each pair of integers in the remaining array will become equal.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A_{1}, A_{2}, \dots, A_{N}.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the minimum number of integers to be deleted to satisfy the given condition.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 10^{4}$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ A_{i} ≤ 10^{9}$
- Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^{5}$.

Test case $1$: There is only one pair of integers and the absolute difference between them is $|A_{1} - A_{2}| = |1 - 2| = 1$. So there is no need to delete any integer from the given array.

Test case $2$: If the integers $1$ and $5$ are deleted, the array A becomes $[2, 2, 2]$ and the absolute difference between each pair of integers is $0$. There is no possible way to delete less than two integers to satisfy the given condition.
