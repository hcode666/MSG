Let X be the set of all integers between 0 and n-1. Suppose we have a collection S_{1}, S_{2}, ..., S_{m} of subsets of X. Say an atom A is a subset of X such that for each S_{i} we have either A is a subset of S_{i} or A and S_{i} do not have any common elements.

Your task is to find a collection A_{1}, ..., A_{k} of atoms such that every item in X is in some A_{i} and no two A_{i}, A_{j} with i ≠ j share a common item. Surely such a collection exists as we could create a single set {x} for each x in X. A more interesting question is to minimize k, the number of atoms.

------ Input ------ 

The first line contains a single positive integer t ≤ 30 indicating the number of test cases. Each test case begins with two integers n,m where n is the size of X and m is the number of sets S_{i}. Then m lines follow where the i'th such line begins with an integer v_{i} between 1 and n (inclusive) indicating the size of S_{i}. Following this are v_{i} distinct integers between 0 and n-1 that describe the contents of S_{i}.

You are guaranteed that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 
30. Furthermore, each number between 0 and n-1 will appear in at least one set S_{i}.

------ Output ------ 

For each test case you are to output a single integer indicating the minimum number of atoms that X can be partitioned into to satisfy the constraints.
