One day, Chef prepared D brand new dishes. He named the i-th dish by a string S_{i}. After the cooking, he decided to categorize each of these D dishes as special or not.

A dish S_{i} is called special if it's name (i.e. the string S_{i}) can be represented in the form of a double string by removing at most one (possibly zero) character from it's name from any position. 

A string is called a double string if it can be represented as a concatenation of two identical, non-empty strings. 
e.g. "abab" is a double string as it can be represented as "ab" + "ab" where + operation denotes concatenation. 
Similarly, "aa", "abcabc" are double strings whereas "a", "abba", "abc" are not.

------ Input ------ 

First line of the input contains an integer D denoting the number of dishes prepared by Chef on that day.
Each of the next D lines will contain description of a dish. 
	
The i-th line contains the name of i-th dish S_{i}.
 	
------ Output ------ 

For each of the D dishes, print a single line containing "YES" or "NO" (without quotes) denoting whether the dish can be called as a special or not.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ D ≤ 10^{6}$
$1 ≤ |S_{i}| ≤ 10^{6}.$
$Each character of string S_{i} will be lower case English alphabet (i.e. from 'a' to 'z').$

------ Subtasks ------ 

Subtask #1 : (20 points)

$Sum of |S_{i}| in an input file doesn't exceed 2 * 10^{3}$

Subtask 2 : (80 points) 

$Sum of |S_{i}| in an input file doesn't exceed 2 * 10^{6}$

----- Sample Input 1 ------ 
3
aba
abac
abcd
----- Sample Output 1 ------ 
YES
NO
NO
----- explanation 1 ------ 
Example case 1.
We can remove the character at position 1 (0-based index) to get "aa" which is a double string. Hence, it is a special dish.

Example case 2.
It is not possible to remove the character at any of the position to get the double string. Hence, it is not a special dish.
