You are given a sequence of integers $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{N}$. This sequence is circular ― for each valid $i$, the element $A_{i+1}$ follows after $A_{i}$, and the element $A_{1}$ follows after $A_{N}$.

You may insert any positive integers at any positions you choose in this sequence; let's denote the resulting sequence by $B$. This sequence is also circular. For each pair of its elements $B_{s}$ and $B_{f}$, let's denote the (non-circular) sequence created by starting at $B_{s}$ and moving from each element to the one that follows after it, until we reach $B_{f}$, by $B(s, f)$. This sequence includes the elements $B_{s}$ and $B_{f}$.

For each $K$ from $2$ to $N$ inclusive, find the smallest possible number of elements that need to be inserted into $A$ to form a sequence $B$ for which there is no subsequence $B(p, q)$ such that:
The size of $B(p, q)$ is at least $K$.
There is no pair of consecutive elements in $B(p, q)$ such that their GCD is equal to $1$.

------  Input ------
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{N}$.

------  Output ------
For each test case, print a single line containing $N-1$ space-separated integers. For each $i$ ($1 ≤ i ≤ N-1$), the $i$-th of these integers should be the smallest number of inserted elements in a valid sequence $B$ for $K = i+1$.

------  Constraints ------
$1 ≤ T ≤ 2,000$
$2 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ A_{i} ≤ 10^{9}$ for each valid $i$
the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^{6}$
