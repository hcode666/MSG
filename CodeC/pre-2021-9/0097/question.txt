As we know, Danny has a huge army and each time she wins a battle the size of her army is increased. Missandei, her advisor and Handmaiden, keeps the log of each battle and the amount and strength of soldiers won in a battle. 

Now, Danny has some questions for Missandei in which she asks the strength of the army gained during some battles. She will ask the query of the form $L, R$ and Missandei has to tell the strength gained in between the $L$ and $R$ battles. Help Missandei. 

You are given an array $A$, where $A[i]$ represents the number of soldiers won in $i^{th}$ battle and the strength of a soldier who was won in $i^{th}$ battle is given in another array $B[i]$. ( $B[i]$ represents the strength of each soldier who was won in the $i^{th}$ battle). 

------ Input: ------

First line will contain $N$ and $Q$, number of battles fought and number of queries. 
Next line contains $N$ space separated integers denoting the array $A$.
Next line contains $N$ space separated integers denoting the array $B$.
Next $Q$ lines contain two integers $L$ and $R$.

------ Output: ------
For each query, output the strength gained in between the $L$ and $R$ battles (both inclusive).

------ Constraints  ------
$1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 1000$
$0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^{6}$
$0 ≤ B[i] ≤ 10^{6}$
$1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N$

----- explanation 1 ------ 
For the first query, strength gained in $2^{nd}$ battle is $2*3 = 6$ and in $3^{rd}$ battle is $3*1 = 3$. Total = $6 + 3 = 9$.
