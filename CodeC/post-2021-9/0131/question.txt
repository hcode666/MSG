There are N piles where the i^{th} pile consists of A_{i} stones.

Chef and Chefina are playing a game taking alternate turns with Chef starting first.  
In his/her turn, a player can choose any non-empty pile and remove exactly 1 stone from it. 

The game ends when exactly 1 pile becomes empty. The player who made the last move wins.  
Determine the winner if both players play optimally.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of piles.
- Next line contains N space-separated integers A_{1}, A_{2}, \dots, A_{N} - denoting the number of stones in each pile.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, output CHEF if Chef wins the game, otherwise output CHEFINA.

Note that the output is case-insensitive i.e. CHEF, Chef, cHeF, and chef are all considered the same.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 1000$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ A_{i} ≤ 10^{9}$
- Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^{5}$.

----- explanation 1 ------ 
Test Case $1$: No matter which stone Chef removes, Chefina will remove the remaining stone from the same pile and make it empty.

Test Case $2$: Since there is only $1$ pile containing $10$ stones, the game will last exactly $10$ moves with last move made by Chefina.

Test Case $3$: Chef can remove $1$ stone from the first pile and thus make it empty.
