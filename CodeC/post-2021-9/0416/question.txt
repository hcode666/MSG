Chefina has an array A consisting of N non-negative integers.

The *beauty* of a subsequence S is defined as 3 \cdot 
\texttt{abs(means(S) - median(S))},  
where \texttt{mean(S)} denotes the [mean] of subsequence S and \texttt{median(S)} denotes the [median] of subsequence S.

Now, Chefina asks Chef to choose a subsequence S of size 3 from array A such that the *beauty* of S is minimised. Your task is to find the minimum *beauty* possible.

As a reminder, a subsequence of an array is obtained by deleting some elements from the array without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Note: It can be proven that the answer is always an integer.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N — the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers, the elements of the array A.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum *beauty* possible of any subsequence of array A, having length 3.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 500$
$3 ≤ N ≤ 5\cdot 10^{3}$
$0  ≤ A_{i} ≤ 10^{9} $
- Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5\cdot 10^{3}$. 

------ subtasks ------ 

Subtask 1 (10 points): $1 ≤ M ≤ 10$
Subtask 2 (20 points): The sum of $N$ across all test cases won't exceed $20$.
Subtask 3 (70 points): No further constraints.

Test case $1$: For the given array $[1, 6, 8, 0]$, Chef will choose the subsequence $[1, 6, 8]$ for minimum beauty.
- The mean of subsequence will be $\frac{(1 + 6 + 8)}{3} = 5$
- The median of subsequence will be $6$ (as it is the middle element after sorting the subsequence). 
- The beauty of the subsequence is $3\cdot$ $\texttt{abs(5-6)}$ $= 3$.

It can be shown that this is the minimum beauty that can be obtained using any subsequence of size $3$.

Test case $2$: For the given array $[5, 5, 7, 0, 1, 0, 4, 7, 9, 4]$, Chef will choose subsequence $[1, 4, 7]$ for minimum beauty.
- The mean of subsequence will be $\frac{(1 + 4 + 7)}{3} = 4$
- The median of subsequence will be $4$ (as it is the middle element after sorting the subsequence). 
- The beauty of the subsequence is $3\cdot$ $\texttt{abs(4-4)}$ $= 0$.

It can be shown that this is the minimum beauty that can be obtained using any subsequence of size $3$.
