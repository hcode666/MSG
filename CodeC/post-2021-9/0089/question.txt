Chef considers a permutation P of \{1, 2, 3, \dots, N\} End Sorted if and only if P_{1} = 1 and P_{N} = N.

Chef is given a permutation P.

In one operation Chef can choose any index i \ (1 ≤ i ≤ N-1) and swap P_{i} and P_{i+1}. Determine the minimum number of operations required by Chef to make the permutation P End Sorted.

Note: An array P is said to be a permutation of \{1, 2, 3, \dots, N\} if P contains each element of \{1, 2, 3, \dots, N\} exactly once. 

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two lines of input.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the length of the permutation P.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, \ldots, P_{N}, denoting the permutation P.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, output minimum number of operations required by Chef to make the permutation P End Sorted.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 1000$
$2 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}$
$P$ is a permutation of $\{1, 2, 3, \dots N\}$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^{5}$.

Test case $1$: $P$ is already End Sorted.

Test case $2$: $P$ can be made End Sorted using $3$ operations as follows: $[3, 2, 1] \to [\textcolor{red}{2, 3}, 1] \to [2, \textcolor{red}{1, 3}] \to [\textcolor{red}{1, 2}, 3]$. It can be shown that achieving this in fewer than $3$ moves is impossible.

Test case $3$: $P$ can be made End Sorted using one operation, by swapping $1$ and $2$.

Test case $4$: $P$ can be made End Sorted using one operation, by swapping $1$ and $2$.
