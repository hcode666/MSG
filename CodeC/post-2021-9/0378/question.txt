You are given a binary string S = S_{1S}_2 \ldots S_{N} of length N. You are also given an integer K. You can do the following operation at most N-K+1 times:
First, choose a substring S_{iS}_{i+1} \ldots S_{i+K-1} of S of length exactly K. This substring shouldn't have been chosen in any of the previous operations. That is, the same starting index of the substring can't be chosen twice.
Then, flip all the characters of the chosen substring (i.e. change every 0 to 1 and vice versa).

Find the lexicographically smallest string possible after the operations if you do them in an optimal way.

Note:
A substring is consecutive elements of a string. For eg. in the string "01011", "101" is a substring, but "111" is not a substring.
A string A is lexicographically smaller than string B, if A_{i} < B_{i}, where i is the first index where A and B differ.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers: N, K.
- The second line of each test case contains the string S.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, output on a new line the lexicographically smallest string that you can achieve.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 100$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ K ≤ N$
- Each element of $S$ is either $0$ or $1$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases won't exceed $3 \times 10^{5}$.

------ subtasks ------ 

Subtask 1 (10 points): $1 ≤ M ≤ 10$
Subtask 2 (20 points): The sum of $N$ across all test cases won't exceed $20$.
Subtask 3 (70 points): No further constraints.

Test case $1$: Choose the substring $1\textcolor{red}{01}$ and flip it. So now $S$ becomes $110$. Then choose the substring $\textcolor{red}{11}0$ and flip it. So now $S$ becomes $000$. This is the lexicographically smallest string that can be achieved, and hence this is the answer.

Test case $2$: Choose the substring $1\textcolor{red}{01}1$ and flip it. So now $S$ becomes $1101$. Then choose the substring $\textcolor{red}{11}01$ and flip it. So now $S$ becomes $0001$. This is the lexicographically smallest string that can be achieved, and hence this is the answer.

Test case $3$: Choose the substring $0\textcolor{red}{101}0$ and flip it. So now $S$ becomes $00100$. Then choose the substring $00\textcolor{red}{100}$ and flip it. So now $S$ becomes $00011$. This is the lexicographically smallest string that can be achieved, and hence this is the answer.

Test case $4$: Choose the substring $01\textcolor{red}{01}0$ and flip it. So now $S$ becomes $01100$. Then choose the substring $0\textcolor{red}{11}00$ and flip it. So now $S$ becomes $00000$. This is the lexicographically smallest string that can be achieved, and hence this is the answer.
