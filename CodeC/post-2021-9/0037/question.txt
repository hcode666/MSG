Some time ago, Chef bought X stocks at the cost of Rs. Y each. Today, Chef is going to sell all these X stocks at Rs. Z each. What is Chef's total profit after he sells them?

Chef's profit equals the total amount he received by selling the stocks, minus the total amount he spent buying them.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers X, Y and Z — the number of stocks, the price they were bought at, and the price they can be sold at, respectively.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case print on a new line a single integer — Chef's profit after selling all the stocks he has.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 100$
$1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 10^{4}$
$Y ≤ Z ≤ 10^{4}$

Test Case 1: Chef bought $X = 2$ stocks for $Y = 5$ each, making the total amount spent by Chef $ = 2 \cdot 5 = 10$.

Chef can sell this stock today for $Z = 20$, making the total amount received by Chef $ =  2 \cdot 20 = 40$.

The total profit is then the amount received minus the amount spent, which equals $40 - 10 = 30$.

Test Case 2: Chef bought $X = 3$ stocks for $Y = 1$ each, making the total amount spent by Chef $ = 3 \cdot 1 = 3$.

Chef can sell this stock today for $Z = 2$, making the total amount received by Chef $ =  3 \cdot 2 = 6$.

The total profit is then the amount received minus the amount spent, which equals $6 - 3 = 3$.

Test Case 3: Chef bought $X = 4$ stocks for $Y = 5$ each, making the total amount spent by Chef $ = 4 \cdot 5 = 20$.

Chef can sell this stock today for $Z = 6$, making the total amount received by Chef $ =  4 \cdot 6 = 24$.

The total profit is then the amount received minus the amount spent, which equals $24 - 20 = 4$
