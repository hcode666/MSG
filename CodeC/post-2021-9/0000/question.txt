Chef has a square-shaped chart paper with the side length equal to N. He wants to cut out K \times K squares from this chart paper. 

Find the maximum number of K \times K squares he can cut from the entire chart paper.

Note that, some part of the chart paper might not be a included in any K \times K cutout square.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K — the side length of the entire chart paper and the side length of the cutout squares.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, output on a new line the maximum number of K \times K squares Chef can cut from the entire chart paper.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 1000$
$1 ≤ K ≤N ≤ 1000$

Test case 1: Chef can cut out $25$ squares of size $1 \times 1$ from the entire $5 \times 5$ chart paper.

Test case 2: Chef can cut out $1$ square of size $2 \times 2$ from the entire $2 \times 2$ chart paper.

Test case 3: Chef can cut out $4$ squares of size $2 \times 2$ from the entire $5 \times 5$ chart paper.
