Chef has two integers X and S. He is interested in sequences of non-negative integers such that the sum of their elements is S and the [bitwise OR] of their elements is X. Chef would like to know the shortest possible length such a sequence can have.

Formally, find the smallest positive integer N such that there exists a sequence A = [A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{N}] satisfying the following conditions:
Each A_{i} is a non-negative integer
A_{1} + A_{2} + \ldots + A_{N} = S
A_{1} \vee A_{2} \vee \ldots \vee A_{N} = X

where \vee denotes the bitwise OR operation.

If there does not exist any sequence which satisfies the above conditions, output -1. Otherwise, output the minimum possible length of such a sequence.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing two space-separated integers X and S — the required bitwise OR and sum, respectively.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, output a single line containing one integer — the shortest possible length of such a sequence, or -1 if no such sequence exists.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 1000$
$1 ≤ X ≤ S ≤ 10^{9}$

Test Case $1$: One of the valid arrays of length $3$ is $[9,9,5]$. It can be shown that there is no valid array with length $< 3$.

Test Case $2$: There does not exist any sequence whose sum is $13$ and bitwise OR is $6$.

Test Case $3$: The valid array of minimum length contains $25$ ones.
