Chef's exam is near. There is a total of M subjects in his syllabus. Each subject consists of several topics. However, the questions will be set only from N topics. These topics are numbered 1 through N. The i^{th} topic belongs to C_{i}^{th} subject and takes T_{i} hours to cover.

Chef has only K hours left before the exam and wants to score the maximum marks. If Chef covers x_{1} number of topics of the 1^{st} subject, x_{2} number of topics of the 2^{nd} subject, and so on upto  x_{M} number of topics of the M^{th} subject in the remaining K hours, he will get a total of \lceil \frac{x_{1}}{2} \ \rceil + \lceil \frac{x_{2}}{2} \ \rceil + \cdots + \lceil \frac{x_{M}}{2} \ \rceil marks in the exam. So Chef chooses the topics optimally.

Determine the maximum possible marks Chef can score in the exam.

Note: \lceil x \rceil : Returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to x (i.e  rounds up to the nearest integer). For example, \lceil 1.5 \rceil = 2, \lceil 5 \rceil = 5.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- Each test case contains three lines of input.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M, K.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers C_{1}, C_{2}, \dots, C_{N}.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers T_{1}, T_{2}, \dots, T_{N}.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the maximum marks Chef can score.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 10^{4}$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ M ≤ N$
$1 ≤ K ≤ 10^{9}$
$1 ≤ C_{i} ≤ M$
$1 ≤ T_{i} ≤ 10^{9}$
- Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5\cdot10^{5}$.

Test case $1$: Chef covers the $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ topic in $1 + 1 = 2$ hours. Both topics belongs to $1^{st}$ subject. He does not cover any topic of the second subject. By doing so, Chef gets $\lceil \frac{2}{2} \ \rceil + \lceil \frac{0}{2} \ \rceil$ = $\lceil \ 1 \ \rceil + \lceil \ 0 \ \rceil = 1$ marks.

Test case $2$: Chef covers the $1^{st}$ topic which belongs to the first subject and $4^{th}$ topic which belongs to the second subject in $1 + 1 = 2$ hours. There is no topic from the third subject. So Chef gets $\lceil \frac{1}{2} \ \rceil + \lceil \frac{1}{2} \ \rceil$ = $\lceil \ 0.5 \ \rceil + \lceil \ 0.5 \ \rceil = 1 + 1 = 2$ marks.
