This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference is that, in this version, K_{i} ≤ 10^{18}.

There’s a [tree] having N nodes, out of which, some nodes are energetic.

Initially, energy of all the nodes is 0. In the i^{th} second, every energetic node will make the energy of itself and all its neighbours increase by i.

You need to answer Q queries. For the i^{th} query, you are given three integers: 
 
X_{i} T_{i} K_{i} : Find the minimum number of seconds after which, there are at least T_{i} nodes with energy not less than K_{i} on the path from node 1 to node X_{i}. If it is not possible to have at least T_{i} nodes with energy not less than K_{i} on the path from node 1 to node X_{i} after any amount of time, print -1 instead.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line contains an integer N — the number of nodes.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers, the array A denoting whether the nodes are energetic. If A_{i} = 1, it means that the i^{th} node is energetic, otherwise the i^{th} node is not energetic.
- The next N-1 lines describe the edges. The i^{th} of these N-1 lines contains two space-separated integers U_{i} and V_{i}, denoting an edge between U_{i} and V_{i}.
- The next line contains an integer Q — the number of queries.
- The next Q lines contain three space-separated integers X_{i},T_{i},K_{i}, the query.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each query, output on a new line: the minimum number of seconds after which, there are at least T_{i} nodes with energy not less than K_{i} on the path from node 1 to node X_{i}.  
If it is not possible to have at least T_{i} nodes with energy not less than K_{i} on the path from node 1 to node X_{i} after any amount of time, print -1 instead.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ N,Q ≤ 4\cdot 10^{4}$
$0 ≤ A_{i}≤ 1$
$1 ≤ U_{i}, V_{i},X_{i},T_{i} ≤ N$
$1 ≤ K_{i} ≤ 10^{18}$

Query $1$: No matter how long, there will not be at least $3$ nodes having energy not less than $1$ on the path from node $1$ to node $7$. Thus, the answer is $-1$.

Query $2$: In the $1^{st}$ second, the energy of nodes $1,3,$ and $6$ becomes $2,3,$ and $2$ respectively. Thus, there are at least $3$ nodes with energy not less than $2$.

Query $3$: In the $2^{nd}$ second, the energy of nodes $1,4,$ and $7$ becomes $6,3,$ and $0$ respectively. Thus, there are at least $2$ nodes with energy not less than $3$.

Query $4$: In the $3^{rd}$ second, the energy of nodes $1,3,$ and $5$ is $12,18,$ and $6$ respectively. Thus, there are at least $3$ nodes with energy not less than $5$.
