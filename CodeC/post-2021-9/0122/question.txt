You are given an array A of size N. In one operation, you can do the following:
Select indices i and j (i\neq j) and set A_{i} = A_{j}.  

Find the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N — the size of the array.
- The next line contains N space-separated integers, denoting the array A.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 1000$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 2\cdot 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ A_{i} ≤ N$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases won't exceed $2\cdot 10^{5}$.

Test case $1$: The minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal is $2$. A possible sequence of operations is:
- Select indices $1$ and $2$ and set $A_{1} = A_{2} = 2$.
- Select indices $3$ and $2$ and set $A_{3} = A_{2} = 2$.

Thus, the final array is $[2, 2, 2]$.

Test case $2$: The minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal is $2$. A possible sequence of operations is:
- Select indices $3$ and $2$ and set $A_{3} = A_{2} = 2$.
- Select indices $4$ and $3$ and set $A_{4} = A_{3} = 2$.

Thus, the final array is $[2, 2, 2, 2]$.

Test case $3$: The minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal is $3$. A possible sequence of operations is:
- Select indices $2$ and $1$ and set $A_{2} = A_{1} = 3$.
- Select indices $3$ and $1$ and set $A_{3} = A_{1} = 3$.
- Select indices $4$ and $1$ and set $A_{4} = A_{1} = 3$.

Thus, the final array is $[3, 3, 3, 3]$.
