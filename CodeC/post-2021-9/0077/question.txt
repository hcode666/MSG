Tonmoy has a special torch. The torch has 4 levels numbered 1 to 4 and 2 states (\texttt{On} and \texttt{Off}). Levels 1, 2, and 3 correspond to the \texttt{On} state while level 4 corresponds to the \texttt{Off} state. 

The levels of the torch can be changed as:
Level 1 changes to level 2.
Level 2 changes to level 3.
Level 3 changes to level 4.
Level 4 changes to level 1.

Given the initial state as K and the number of changes made in the levels as N, find the final state of the torch. If the final state cannot be determined, print \texttt{Ambiguous} instead.

------ Input Format ------ 

- First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers N, K - the number of changes made in the levels and initial state of the torch. Here, K = 0 denotes \texttt{Off} state while K = 1 denotes \texttt{On} state. 

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, output in a single line, the final state of the torch, i.e. \texttt{On} or \texttt{Off}. If the final state cannot be determined, print \texttt{Ambiguous} instead.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings \texttt{On}, \texttt{ON}, \texttt{on} and \texttt{oN} will all be treated as identical).

------ Constraints ------

$0 ≤ K ≤ 1$

Test Case $1$: Initially, the torch is in $\texttt{Off}$ state. Since only level $4$ corresponds to the $\texttt{Off}$ state, the torch is at level $4$ initially. After $4$ changes, the final level would be $4$. Level $4$ corresponds to the $\texttt{Off}$ state. Hence, finally the torch is $\texttt{Off}$. 

Test Case $2$: Initially, the torch is in $\texttt{On}$ state. After $0$ changes, the torch remains in the $\texttt{On}$ state.

Test Case $3$: Initially, the torch is in $\texttt{On}$ state. This can correspond to any of the first $3$ levels. Thus, we cannot determine the final level after $3$ changes. Hence, the final state is $\texttt{Ambiguous}$.
