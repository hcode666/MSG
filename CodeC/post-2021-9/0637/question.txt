There are N types of medicines and M types of diseases where medicine types are numbered from 1 to N and disease types are numbered from 1 to M. You have infinite medicines of each type.

For every disease d, you have a strength f(d). Initially, f(d) = 0 for all 1 ≤ d ≤ M.

The i^{th} medicine increments your strength for a particular disease (say x_{i}) and decrements your strength for another disease (say y_{i}).
In particular, if you take the medicine of i^{th} type, then:

f(x_{i}) \to f(x_{i}) + 1 
f(y_{i}) \to f(y_{i}) - 1

Let S  be a subset of the M diseases. You are considered immune to S if and only if, there exists a finite number of medicines you can take such that after you take all those medicines, you have f(d) > 0  for all d \in S. 

Remember that you have infinite medicines of each type. So you could take 10 medicines of type 1, and 3 medicines of type 2, etc. 

Count the number of subsets of diseases you are immune to. Print the number modulo 10^{9} + 7.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M — the number of types of medicines and the number of types of diseases, respectively.
- The next N lines describe the medicines. The i^{th} of these N lines contain two space-separated integers x_{i} and y_{i}, denoting the disease on which the strength increases and decreases respectively after taking the i^{th} medicine.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, output on a new line, the number of subsets of diseases you are immune to, modulo 10^{9} + 7.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 1000$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}$
$2 ≤ M ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ M$
$x_{i} \neq y_{i}$ and the ordered pair $(x_{i}, y_{i})$ is pairwise distinct for $1 ≤ i ≤ N$.
- The sum of $N + M$ over all test cases won't exceed $3 \cdot 10^{5}$.

----- explanation 1 ------ 
Test case $1$: There are $4$ subsets of diseases that you are immune to.

- The $\{\}$ set: there are no diseases so you are automatically immune to the empty set.
- $\{2\}$: If you take the first tablet, you become immune.
- $\{3\}$: If you take the second tablet, you become immune.
- $\{2, 3\}$: If you take the first and second tablet then your, $f(1)$ becomes $-2$, $f(2)$ becomes $1$ and $f(3)$ becomes $1$. Which makes you immune to this subset.
    
It can be proven that you are not immune to any other subset.
