Chef likes to spend his summer vacation playing with strings. Chef likes alternating patterns, but he only likes the characters \texttt{a} and \texttt{b}, so he does the following:

Chef starts with an empty string S. Then, 
First, he appends \texttt{a} once to S
Next, he appends \texttt{b} twice to S
Next, he appends \texttt{a} thrice to S
Next, he appends \texttt{b} four times to S

and so on. For example, the first 13 characters of S are \texttt{abbaaabbbbaaa}.

Now, Chef takes the string formed by the first N characters of S, and wants to calculate its *beauty*. The beauty of a string is calculated as follows:
First, we define the *value* of a string A to be the number of positions 1 ≤ i < |A| such that A_{i} \neq A_{i+1}. For example, the value of \texttt{aaa} is 0 and the value of \texttt{abba} is 2.
Then, the *beauty* of a string is defined to be the sum of values of all its [substrings]. Two substrings are considered distinct if they occur at different positions, so every string of length K has exactly K\cdot(K+1)/2 substrings.

You are given N. Help Chef by calculating the beauty of the string formed by the first N characters of S. The answer may be large, so report it modulo 1000000007.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, output in a single line the beauty of the string modulo 10^{9} + 7.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{9}$

Test case $1$: The first three characters of $S$ are $\texttt{abb}$. The values of the substrings are as follows:
- $\texttt{a}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{bb}$ have a value of $0$.
- $\texttt{ab}, \texttt{abb}$ have a value of $1$.

So, the beauty of the string is $2$.

Test case $2$: The first $4$ characters of $S$ are $\texttt{abba}$. Its substrings of non-zero value are:
- $\texttt{ab}, \texttt{abb}, \texttt{ba}, \texttt{bba}$ with value $1$
- $\texttt{abba}$ with value $2$.

So, the beauty of the string is $1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6$.
