An array is called *lovely* if the sum of product of each adjacent pair of elements is odd.

More formally, the array S of size M is lovely if the value \sum_{i=1}^{M-1} (S_{i} . S_{i+1}) is odd.

You are given an array A consisting of N positive integers. Find a [permutation] of array A which is *lovely*. 

If multiple such permutations are possible, output any. If there is no *lovely* permutation, output -1.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A_{1}, A_{2}, \dots, A_{N}.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, if a *lovely* permutation of A is possible, print a single line containing N integers denoting the elements of any *lovely* permutation of A. Otherwise, print -1.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤T ≤1000$
$2 ≤N ≤500$
$1 ≤A_{i} ≤10^{6}$

Test Case $1$: The sum of products of adjacent pair of elements of the given array is $1\cdot 2 + 2\cdot 3 + 3\cdot 4 + 4\cdot 10 = 2+6+12+40 = 60$. Since this value is even, this is not a *lovely* permutation of the array.  
A *lovely* permutation of the given array is $[3, 1, 10, 2, 4]$. The sum of products for this array would be $3\cdot 1 + 1\cdot 10 + 10\cdot 2 + 2\cdot 4 = 41$, which is odd.

Test Case $2$: No permutation of the given array exists where the sum of products of adjacent pair of elements is odd. Thus, answer is $-1$.
