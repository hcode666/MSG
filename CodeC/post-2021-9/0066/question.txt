*Chef has recently introduced a [feature], called WA Test Cases, which allows you to see the smallest test case that your WA code has failed in. For example, you can go to any relevant problem in [Practice], make a submission which gets a WA verdict, and then click on the "Debug My Code" button to see the test case.*

Your job now is to find that smallest test case that a particular submission fails on. That problem has N test cases, and you are given the size of each of those test cases as S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, S_{N}. You are also given a binary string V, which tells whether the submission has passed a particular test case or not. That is, if the i^{th} bit of V is 1, that means that the submission has passed the i^{th} test case. If it is 0, then it has failed that test case. Your job is the output the size of the smallest test case where the submission has failed.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer, N.
- The second line contains N integers - S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, S_{N}
- The third line contains a binary string - V.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, output on a new line, a single integer, which should be the size of the smallest test case where the submission has failed.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 100$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 100$
$1 ≤ S_{i} ≤ 100$
- Length of $V = N$
- Each element of $V$ is either $0$ or $1$
- At least one element of $V$ will be $0$

------ subtasks ------ 

Subtask 1 (10 points): $1 ≤ M ≤ 10$
Subtask 2 (20 points): The sum of $N$ across all test cases won't exceed $20$.
Subtask 3 (70 points): No further constraints.

Test case 1: There are $3$ test cases, and the submission has failed all the $3$ test cases. The sizes of the test cases on which it has failed are $\{5, 10, 3\}$. The smallest among these is $3$, and so the answer is $3$.

Test case 2: There are $3$ test cases, and the submission has failed on $2$ test cases. The sizes of the test cases on which it has failed are $\{5, 10\}$. The smallest among these is $5$, and so the answer is $5$.

Test case 3: There are $3$ test cases, and the submission has failed on $2$ test cases. The sizes of the test cases on which it has failed are $\{5, 5\}$. The smallest among these is $5$, and so the answer is $5$.

Test case 4: There are $3$ test cases, and the submission has failed on $1$ test case. The sizes of the test case on which it has failed is $\{5\}$. The smallest among these is $5$, and so the answer is $5$.

Test case 5: There are $5$ test cases, and the submission has failed on $4$ test cases. The sizes of the test cases on which it has failed are $\{10, 100, 100, 10\}$. The smallest among these is $10$, and so the answer is $10$.
