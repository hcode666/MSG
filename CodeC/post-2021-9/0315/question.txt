You are given a binary string S. A binary string is a string consisting of only 0's and 1's.

A binary string is called *good* if it has an equal number of occurrences of \texttt{01} substrings and \texttt{10} substrings. Note that these substrings may overlap. For example, the string 1101001 is *good* since there are two occurrences of \texttt{01} (11\underline{01}001 and 11010\underline{01}) and two occurrences of \texttt{10} (1\underline{10}1001 and 110\underline{10}01).

Find the number of indices i (1 ≤ i ≤ |S|) such that after flipping S_{i}, the resultant binary string is *good*. (If S_{i} is 0, flipping it changes it to 1, and if S_{i} is 1, flipping it changes it to 0)

Note: A string A is a substring of a string B if A can be obtained from B by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The second line of each test case contains a binary string S containing 0s and 1s only.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, output on a single line the number indices i such that flipping S_{i} results in a *good* binary string.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 10^{5}$
$2 ≤ |S| ≤ 2\cdot10^{5}$
- The sum of lengths of $S$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\cdot10^{5}$.

Test case 1: When $i = 1$, flipping $S_{1}$ produces the string $00100$, which is *good* since there is one occurrence of $\texttt{01}$ ($0\underline{01}00$) and one occurrence of $\texttt{10}$ ($00\underline{10}0$).

When $i = 5$, flipping $S_{5}$ produces the string $10101$, which is *good* since there are two occurrences of $\texttt{01}$ ($1\underline{01}01$ and $101\underline{01}$) and are two occurrences of $\texttt{10}$ ($\underline{10}101$ and $10\underline{10}1$).

It can be shown that for $i = 2, 3, 4$ flipping $S_{i}$ does not result in a *good* binary string.

Thus the number of indices resulting in a good binary string is $2$.
