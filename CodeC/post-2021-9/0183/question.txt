Chef has an array A having N elements. Chef wants to make all the elements of the array equal by repeating the following move.

Choose any integer K between 1 and N (inclusive). Then choose K distinct indices i_{1} , i_{2}, \dots, i_{K}, and increase the values of A_{i_{1}} , A_{i_{2}} , \dots , A_{i_{K}} by 1.

Find the minimum number of moves required to make all the elements of the array equal. 

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in A.
- The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers A_{1}, A_{2}, \dots, A_{N}.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer denoting the minimum number of moves required to make all the elements of the array equal. 

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 10^{4}$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ A_{i} ≤ 10^{5}$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^{5}$.

- Test Case $1$: In the first move, Chef can choose $K = 2$, and choose the indices $\{1 , 3\}$. After increasing $A_{1}$ and $A_{3}$ by $1$, the array will become $[2 , 3 , 2]$.
In the second move, Chef can choose $K = 2$, and choose the indices $\{1 , 3\}$. After increasing $A_{1}$ and $A_{3}$ by $1$, the array will become $[3 , 3 , 3]$, and hence all the elements become equal. 

- Test Case $2$: All the elements of the array are equal, hence no move is required.
