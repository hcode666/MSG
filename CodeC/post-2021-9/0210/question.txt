JJ gives you a number N and challenges you to construct a permutation P of length N such that:
|P_{i + 1} - P_{i}| ≥ 2 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1 (Here |x| denotes the absolute value of x)

Can you complete JJ's challenge?

As a reminder, a permutation of length N is an array where every integer from 1 to N occurs exactly once.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains one integer N — the length of the permutation P to be constructed.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, output N space-separated integers P_{1}, P_{2}, \ldots, P_{N} denoting the permutation P which satisfies the given conditions.

If no such permutation exists, output -1.

If there are multiple answers, print any.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 10^{5}$
$2 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}$
- Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^{5}$

----- Sample Input 1 ------ 
2
2
6

----- Sample Output 1 ------ 
-1
1 4 2 5 3 6

----- explanation 1 ------ 
Test Case 1: It can be proven that no permutation of length $2$ exists that satisfies the given conditions.

Test Case 2: $[1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]$ satisfies the given condition, since $|P_{i + 1} - P_{i}| ≥ 2$ for all $1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1$
